# dk_kurser_repo

**1. Overview**

This repository relates to two .ipynb documents for extracting information from (archived) course webpages. As of current, these are run by the University of Copenhagen & Aarhus University. Information extracted includes:

- Year
- Course code
- Course title
- Course instructors
- Emails of instructors
- Content
- Learning outcomes
- Knowledge
- Skills
- Competencies
- Other information

Codebases are designed to handle inputs in both Danish and English, and produce output in JSON format.

**2. General Progress**

Scraping has been undertaken for Copenhagen university for 2013-2024 and outputs have been approved by Professor Stephen Hansen and Mikkel HÃ¸st Gandil (see QA outputs below). Scraping for Aarhus is in progress, requiring a different approach to Copenhagen due to webpage semantics (plain html vs javascript). Details are located in dk_kurser_total_scrape_aarhus.ipynb.

**3a. Output Quality - Copenhagen**

See below for distribution of missing data across scraped fields for all courses across scoped academic years (Copenhagen):

Note that:

- The code successfully scrapes course information for c. 98% of courses across all years.
- Knowledge, skills and competencies are extracted based on keyword searches from the parent 'content' field - where a keyword match fails (in Danish or English), these are marked as missing. However, NLP methods could be used downstream to extract this information from the content field.
- Course content follows an increasingly formulaic format in later years, explaining higher levels of missingness in 'older' course information.
- Coordinator emails have been cleaned and de-anonymised.

Analysis was also undertaken to understand continuity across text fields over time:

Whilst limited, this suggests a modest increase in the average length of course descriptions over time, even when excluding missing data (more prevalent in earlier years) from the calculation.

**3b. Output Quality - Aarhus**

In the absence of a formal quality assurance, a sampling approach suggests that a typical course for Aarhus extracts the following data: 

=== SAMPLE @ 40/61705 ===
{

"**source_url**": "https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/64882/20-ECTS-Public-Organizations-Leadership-and-Governance",

  ],

"knowledge": null,

"skills": null,

"competencies": null,

"**language**": "Danish",

}

**Suggestions for improvements**

The code is incorrectly/inconsistently extracting data for the following rows, which should be refined going forward:
['coordinators', 'coordinator_emails', 'content', 'learning_outcomes', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'competencies']

Additionally, this code runs infeasibly slowly (>100 hours for a complete scrape) due to the requirement to use playwright to render pages. Methods for optimising this process should be explored.
