            "  \"content\": \"Read more The core course focuses on central normative theories and applying them to important social and global issues. We will concentrate on the following four policy areas: Immigration: To which extent should well-off, liberal states accept refugees and immigrants and which rights should we extend to them? Climate: How should we distribute the costs of climate change? War: Under which circumstances is it just to start a war and what characterises just warfare? Education: How should the education system balance the interests of children, parents and the state regarding what should be learnt and how? Within each area, we will discuss what the relevant normative considerations are and whether concrete political decisions can be justified. Among many other things, we will discuss the EU refugee agreement with Turkey, the intervention in Libya, how the interests of future generations are attended to in the global climate agreements and whether (religious) charter schools are problematic for the welfare state. The course aims to strengthen the participants’ normative theoretical knowledge regarding these policy areas and generally train their ability to balance different normative considerations. The core course builds on the department’s bachelor course in political theory. The latter introduces central isms and concepts within political theory. The core course will also present the debated issue of political theory methods and exemplify this debate using concrete cases. The goal is that participants become able to carry out, critically and creatively, normative analyses of societal problems and concrete political decisions, evaluate the strengths of arguments presented in the public debate and develop their own positions. Skills that can be crucial in future jobs where analysis, advice to decision-makers and leadership are important. ”Normative concepts such as freedom, democracy and justice are of great importance to political communication and to the content of many political decisions and their implementation. Regardless of whether as a future civil servant, one is to advise politicians or whether one’s job is to research political/administrative matters, one needs to understand the different meanings of concepts and how to apply them to concrete policy areas.” ( Thomas Gregersen, Senior Advisor, The Prime Minister’s Office ) The teaching format of the course is designed to train the participants’ oral and written skills. Within each of the course’s four policy areas, the participants will work in small groups to develop a (short) synopsis regarding a self-chosen research question. Each policy area covered consists of a module of five lessons that ends with the different groups presenting their synopses to each other. The whole course ends with a discussion of the participants’ exam synopses and a presentation and discussion of how to do a master thesis within political theory.\",\n",
            "  \"learning_outcomes\": \"Read more The seminar provides advanced and in-depth treatment of an area of political science research based on an account and discussion of various positions as well as discussions and possibly data sources and methods derived from conventional and contemporary research literature. These research areas may fall within the following fields: Comparative politics, political behaviour and attitude formation, public administration, political institutions and public policy, international politics, political theory and political sociology. The goal of the core course in political science is to strengthen the student’s ability to systematically understand, analyse, discuss and independently assess a large amount of research literature and adopt a critical approach to the course literature. Objectives for the core course in political science: The student is able to account for selected theories, methods and issues within the research area in question at the highest academic level. The student is able to identify the most recent Danish and international research results and any needs for further research within the research area in question. In continuation thereof, the student is able to independently formulate an academic hypothesis related to the course theories, methods and issues and to key and current discussions within the research area in question. The student is able to compare the theories, methods and issues presented throughout the course and identify their differences/similarities and strengths/weaknesses. The student is able to apply theories, approaches, methods and data that are relevant for the analysis of the selected issues.

We will focus on three main themes: a) coordination and management in the public sector; b) public employees; c) The relationship between the administration and political stakeholders – primarily the citizens. More specifically, we focus on discussing questions such as: Why is coordination and management so difficult in the public sector? What is the relationship between the political leadership and the administration? How can we measure performance in public institutions, and what can we use the knowledge for? How can we manage highly professionalized civil servants and public service providers – and is it even possible? Is there an association between citizen satisfaction and public sector performance? And how can the citizens be motivated to engage in public service co-production initiatives? Discussion of these questions is based on a curriculum focusing on more recent Danish and international scholarly contributions of theoretical as well as empirical content. A main aim of the course is to strengthen the participants written as well as oral performance skills. The oral skills are trained through discussions and group-based casework in class as well as between classes and in the final oral exam. The writing skills are practiced through the requirement of handing in small written assignments during the course where participants should demonstrate ability to develop and describe research designs tackling current empirical challenges in public administration. Hence, the course also serves as preparation for participants’ final thesis writing.\",\n",

            "    \"Questions about citizens’ opinions and political behaviours are central to an understanding of modern politics and command great attention by citizens and scholars alike. Countless media articles are written about citizens’ opinions on such issues as immigration and economic redistribution not to mention their voting intentions. Likewise, the scientific literatures on these topics are voluminous and contain a range of different theories and explanations. The factors investigated include both stable influences such as citizens’ biological and psychological dispositions and their location in the social structure, but also more dynamic factors such as communication from the media and political elites. This core course provides a comprehensive, updated overview of the literature stretching from the fundamental approaches and the classic works, to standing debates on perennial topics like voting and tolerance, to current controversies such as the relative weight of socialisation and biology in influencing opinion formation. The insights and approaches of the course have great relevance both outside and inside Academia. For students contemplating careers in both the public and private sectors, the course offers essential insights into key factors defining the social environment in which any politically oriented organization operates: public opinion and voting behaviour. Such insights are key to providing solid advice on everything from the content of new laws to the timing of information campaigns targeting the public. In the shorter run, the course gives participants an ideal vantage point from which to pursue more specialized questions and interests in other seminars and/or in their MA thesis (speciale), but it is also relevant for those who are primarily interested in an overview of the field. The course is structured in three blocks. First, we cover five major approaches to the study of public opinion and political behaviour: The biological approach, the sociological approach, the psychological approach, the rational choice/economic approach, and the communication approach. Readings for this block will be a combination of classic studies and more recent critiques and/or updates. In the second block, we address topics that both in the past and more recently have attracted attention. The list of topics includes ethnic and political tolerance, voting behaviour, support for the welfare state, effects of social networks and the nature of political ideology. In the final block, we delve into current debates about such topics as the relative weight of socialization and biology for attitude formation, the role of self-interest in political attitudes, the extent to which citizens are competent for democracy, the effects of ethnic diversity and the relationship between affect and reason in political behaviour. Throughout each of the blocks, we will discuss potential topics for the final synopses. A substantial number of the classes will be taught in Danish, if the enrolled students' language proficiencies allow it.\",\n",

            "  \"content\": \"Read more Questions about citizens’ opinions and political behaviours are central to an understanding of modern politics and command great attention by citizens and scholars alike. Countless media articles are written about citizens’ opinions on such issues as immigration and economic redistribution not to mention their voting intentions. Likewise, the scientific literatures on these topics are voluminous and contain a range of different theories and explanations. The factors investigated include both stable influences such as citizens’ biological and psychological dispositions and their location in the social structure, but also more dynamic factors such as communication from the media and political elites. This core course provides a comprehensive, updated overview of the literature stretching from the fundamental approaches and the classic works, to standing debates on perennial topics like voting and tolerance, to current controversies such as the relative weight of socialisation and biology in influencing opinion formation. The insights and approaches of the course have great relevance both outside and inside Academia. For students contemplating careers in both the public and private sectors, the course offers essential insights into key factors defining the social environment in which any politically oriented organization operates: public opinion and voting behaviour. Such insights are key to providing solid advice on everything from the content of new laws to the timing of information campaigns targeting the public. In the shorter run, the course gives participants an ideal vantage point from which to pursue more specialized questions and interests in other seminars and/or in their MA thesis (speciale), but it is also relevant for those who are primarily interested in an overview of the field. The course is structured in three blocks. First, we cover five major approaches to the study of public opinion and political behaviour: The biological approach, the sociological approach, the psychological approach, the rational choice/economic approach, and the communication approach. Readings for this block will be a combination of classic studies and more recent critiques and/or updates. In the second block, we address topics that both in the past and more recently have attracted attention. The list of topics includes ethnic and political tolerance, voting behaviour, support for the welfare state, effects of social networks and the nature of political ideology. In the final block, we delve into current debates about such topics as the relative weight of socialization and biology for attitude formation, the role of self-interest in political attitudes, the extent to which citizens are competent for democracy, the effects of ethnic diversity and the relationship between affect and reason in political behaviour. Throughout each of the blocks, we will discuss potential topics for the final synopses. A substantial number of the classes will be taught in Danish, if the enrolled students' language proficiencies allow it.\",\n",

            "    \"Since the end of the Cold War, democracy has gained ground in many new places of the world. Nonetheless, close to half of the world’s countries may still be characterized as autocracies. Furthermore, we still witness frequent movements between and within the categories of ‘democracy’ and ‘dictatorship’. Such overall movements reflect some very concrete ground-level problems: How did, for instance, Vladimir Putin succeed in concentrating power in his own person during the last decade, and are there any signs of political opening? Why has democracy not broken down in Hungary despite the seemingly undemocratic propensities of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán? Why do some countries experience democratic transitions, as has been the case in Tunisia following the Arab Spring and partly in Ukraine’s Majdan Revolution, while others, such as China, North Korea, and Zimbabwe, have remained dictatorial for many decades now? And does it matter, after all, whether countries are democratic or dictatorial when it comes to the ability to deliver economic growth, welfare, and security for the citizens? This seminar centers on these important questions. The working hypothesis is that a qualified answer to these (and other) questions can only come about by having knowledge of a broad spectrum of theories about historical and contemporary empirical examples of regime changes as well as a range of methods to test these theories. The seminar is structured in five parts. The first part establishes the foundation for the following parts. It introduces the historical development and core concepts of the field of research. Afterwards, a number of analytical approaches - which are employed in more recent comparative, either large- or small-n, studies – and some of the most typical data sources are introduced. The aim is, first, to enable the students for critical reflection and assessment of the advantages of the analyses and findings which the rest of seminar grapples with. Second, the aim is to help the students, in their work on the synopsis, in developing their own research design that will support the robustness of an empirical analysis of a specific research question. Building on these necessary tools, we move to the four substantial parts of the seminar: ‘the development and breakdown of democracies’, ‘the deepening and stability of autocracies’, ‘consequences of regime types’, and ‘democracy and dictatorship in different regions’. In the second part, we treat theories regarding democratic transition, consolidation, and breakdown. The aim is to create an overview of the development of democracy spatially and temporally and to understand deeper as well as more proximate explanations of democracy. In the third part, we turn to the variation within the autocratic regime category. We will try to understand the dynamics of ‘soft’ authoritarian regimes as well as totalitarian dictatorships. The outset is that all countries in the authoritarian category share many characteristics but that there is also great variation within the group. Therefore, we ask how to distinguish between different undemocratic regimes and what consequences such differences have for regime survival, the strategies of survival they employ, how they develop, and no less important, how they break down. In the fourth part, we focus on the consequences of the different regime types regarding conditions such as economic development, human rights violations, and civil war. In the fifth part, we explore specific geographic regions – Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America – in order to gain empirical knowledge and improve our ability to apply theories on democracy and dictatorship. Finally, the seminar gives the students the opportunity to develop their own synopsis of a research question that takes its starting point in the extant literature on democracy and dictatorship in comparative perspective. We will discuss the synopses in class. The synopses are to be defended in an oral exam in which the students’ more general knowledge of the seminar’s literature is also assessed.\",\n",

            "    \"In the course, students deal with cutting-edge theories of justice, democracy and citizenship and learn how to apply them to contemporary political problems. Topics include: to what extent increasing inequality is a problem; what treating people equally amounts to; what the appropriate role of the state is with respect to promoting certain conceptions of the good or life-styles; foreign aid and global redistribution; the priority of democracy vis a vis other values such as political order or economic growth; the democratic legitimacy of constitutional courts and supranational organizations; and the requirements immigrants should meet in order to obtain permanent residency and citizenship. The course equips students to conduct normative analyses of key political problems in a critical and creative way, to fairly assess the strength of arguments offered by various participants in the public domain, and to formulate arguments of their own. One very influential theoretical strand of contemporary political theory is luck egalitarianism. It emerged in the wake of John Rawls’ seminal work A Theory of Justice . Luck egalitarians aim to formulate attractive egalitarian theories which are sensitive to considerations of choice and responsibility. This responds to and informs public policies seeking to emphasize individual responsibility in spheres such as health care and the labor market. Despite this common theoretical and practical goal of luck egalitarians, they are deeply divided on the question of what amount to the most appropriate responsibility-sensitive egalitarian theory. Moreover, they are faced with powerful objections from the corners of a competing so-called relational egalitarian camp. They concern luck egalitarians’ allegedly misguided concern with the distributions of goods (as opposed to the creation of equal and respectful relations between individuals), and their complacency with deep inequalities in so far as these are traceable to people’s voluntary choices. Luck egalitarians have, however, responded vigorously and ingeniously to such concerns. One important luck egalitarian response consists in combining choice-sensitive egalitarian theories with some form of paternalism. Paternalistic policies, in brief, restrict people’s liberty in their own interest, that is, are aimed at preventing them from making bad choices for themselves. However, liberals traditionally find such policies repugnant―they are taken to violate people’s autonomy and lead to a nanny state. The course examines this alleged conflict between individual liberty or autonomy and promoting people’s interests or welfare. The relational egalitarian campaign against luck egalitarianism is partly driven by democratic concern. That is, the proponents of this view are concerned with creating and upholding the necessary conditions for people to take part in democratic deliberations on an equal footing. In this way, the literature on justice meshes with theories of democracy. Democratic theories investigates what the relation is between democracy, equality, freedom, reason and universal human rights and how the value of democracy should be balanced against other values such as political order and economic growth. They also ask how we should conceive of democracy in the age of globalization and migration with increased interdependence across national borders and increased cultural and religious diversity. Furthermore, they speak to the social preconditions for a well-functioning democracy at the national and post-national levels, including not least what is required of citizens in terms of their sense of political identity, their virtues and democratic skills. As indicated, all political theories have been challenged by the problem of scope. While they have traditionally been confined more or less to the nation-state, it has become increasingly obvious that this limitation is problematic or at least that it stands in great need of justification.\",\n",

            "  \"content\": \"Read more In the course, students deal with cutting-edge theories of justice, democracy and citizenship and learn how to apply them to contemporary political problems. Topics include: to what extent increasing inequality is a problem; what treating people equally amounts to; what the appropriate role of the state is with respect to promoting certain conceptions of the good or life-styles; foreign aid and global redistribution; the priority of democracy vis a vis other values such as political order or economic growth; the democratic legitimacy of constitutional courts and supranational organizations; and the requirements immigrants should meet in order to obtain permanent residency and citizenship. The course equips students to conduct normative analyses of key political problems in a critical and creative way, to fairly assess the strength of arguments offered by various participants in the public domain, and to formulate arguments of their own. One very influential theoretical strand of contemporary political theory is luck egalitarianism. It emerged in the wake of John Rawls’ seminal work A Theory of Justice . Luck egalitarians aim to formulate attractive egalitarian theories which are sensitive to considerations of choice and responsibility. This responds to and informs public policies seeking to emphasize individual responsibility in spheres such as health care and the labor market. Despite this common theoretical and practical goal of luck egalitarians, they are deeply divided on the question of what amount to the most appropriate responsibility-sensitive egalitarian theory. Moreover, they are faced with powerful objections from the corners of a competing so-called relational egalitarian camp. They concern luck egalitarians’ allegedly misguided concern with the distributions of goods (as opposed to the creation of equal and respectful relations between individuals), and their complacency with deep inequalities in so far as these are traceable to people’s voluntary choices. Luck egalitarians have, however, responded vigorously and ingeniously to such concerns. One important luck egalitarian response consists in combining choice-sensitive egalitarian theories with some form of paternalism. Paternalistic policies, in brief, restrict people’s liberty in their own interest, that is, are aimed at preventing them from making bad choices for themselves. However, liberals traditionally find such policies repugnant―they are taken to violate people’s autonomy and lead to a nanny state. The course examines this alleged conflict between individual liberty or autonomy and promoting people’s interests or welfare. The relational egalitarian campaign against luck egalitarianism is partly driven by democratic concern. That is, the proponents of this view are concerned with creating and upholding the necessary conditions for people to take part in democratic deliberations on an equal footing. In this way, the literature on justice meshes with theories of democracy. Democratic theories investigates what the relation is between democracy, equality, freedom, reason and universal human rights and how the value of democracy should be balanced against other values such as political order and economic growth. They also ask how we should conceive of democracy in the age of globalization and migration with increased interdependence across national borders and increased cultural and religious diversity. Furthermore, they speak to the social preconditions for a well-functioning democracy at the national and post-national levels, including not least what is required of citizens in terms of their sense of political identity, their virtues and democratic skills. As indicated, all political theories have been challenged by the problem of scope. While they have traditionally been confined more or less to the nation-state, it has become increasingly obvious that this limitation is problematic or at least that it stands in great need of justification.\",\n",
            "  \"learning_outcomes\": \"Read more The seminar provides advanced and in-depth treatment of an area of political science research based on an account and discussion of various positions as well as discussions and possibly data sources and methods derived from conventional and contemporary research literature. These research areas may fall within the following fields: Comparative politics, political behaviour and attitude formation, public administration, political institutions and public policy, international politics, political theory and political sociology. The goal of the core course in political science is to strengthen the student’s ability to systematically understand, analyse, discuss and independently assess a large amount of research literature and adopt a critical approach to the course literature. Objectives for the core course in political science: The student is able to account for selected theories, methods and issues within the research area in question at the highest academic level. The student is able to identify the most recent Danish and international research results and any needs for further research within the research area in question. In continuation thereof, the student is able to independently formulate an academic hypothesis related to the course theories, methods and issues and to key and current discussions within the research area in question. The student is able to compare the theories, methods and issues presented throughout the course and identify their differences/similarities and strengths/weaknesses. The student is able to apply theories, approaches, methods and data that are relevant for the analysis of the selected issues. The student is able to assess the fruitfulness of the course theories, methods and their scope of application. The student is able to confidently communicate an academic issue and structure an oral academic presentation and engage in a scholarly dialogue about the topic at hand. The specific objectives for this module are: To make students familiar with cutting-edge theories of justice, democracy and citizenship, and how they can be applied to key political problems To equip student with the requisite tools for undertaking advanced normative analyses of key political problems and to formulate systematic arguments of their own\",\n",

Furthermore, they are expected to acquire knowledge of basic economic principles. Reasoning is based on verbal and graphical analysis combined with experiments and examples. Topics covered are cost concepts, comparative advantage, competitive markets and international trade. An economic approach is emphasized when making and analysing rational decisions. Verbal presentations as well as graphical tools and mathematical approaches are used in this analysis. COURSE SUBJECT AREAS (Micro): Cost-benefit analysis and cost concepts Demand, supply and perfect competition Market imperfections Public economics COURSE SUBJECT AREAS (Macro): Macroeconomic key variables Macroeconomics - the long run Macroeconomics - the short run International economics Feedback The following types of feedback are used in this course: Non-facilitated peer feedback. Peer feedback that is not facilitated by a teacher or instructor, such as discussions students have in study groups. Oral activities in class. Oral activities during the lecture, aimed at giving students feedback on whether they can reflect on course content or on whether they can solve minor exercises. Self-assessment. A teacher provides solution notes for tasks on which students have worked, such as problem sets or cases. Students can solve exercises from an exercise bank with solutions, e.g. using MyEconLab. In-class tests. Short in-class tests, such as multiple choice tests, e.g. using Mentimeter or other online tools. Student presentations in tutorials. Student presentations in tutorials, such as a student presenting a solution to a problem set or presenting a case. Evaluation All Bachelor's and Master's degree courses are part of the joint digital course evaluation at Aarhus BSS.

            "    \"Vi befinder os i en brydningstid, hvor de hidtidige relationer og magtforhold mellem etablerede og nye aktører på den verdenspolitiske scene er under forandring. USA’s unipolære supermagtsstatus synes udfordret af Kina og Rusland. Endvidere har tyngdepunktet i diskussionen om USA’s fremtidige rolle på verdensscenen gradvist ændret sig fra USA’s evne til USA’s vilje til at garantere regional sikkerhed og stabilitet. Dertil kommer, at centrale multilaterale organisationer som NATO og EU synes politisk svækkede som følge af splittelserne medlemmerne imellem og et stigende udefrakommende pres fra begivenheder og aktører i både Vest, Øst og Syd. Brydningstider fordrer fundamentale diskussioner om hensigtsmæssigheden og tilpasningen til de forhold, der undergår forandring på nationalt og internationalt plan. Med andre ord udgør brydningstider såkaldte mulighedsvinduer for forandringer, der ikke før var mulige, men ultimativt også truslen om et komplet kollaps. Således udpegede den danske regering i 2015 Peter Taksøe-Jensen til at granske dansk udenrigspolitik. Det affødte udredningen Dansk diplomati og forsvar i en brydningstid , hvori Taksøe-Jensen kastede ”et frisk blik på hele spektret af instrumenter i den udenrigspolitiske værktøjskasse” og gjorde status på de eksisterende udenrigs- og sikkerhedspolitiske tanke- og handlemønstre. Dette seminar tilbyder dig muligheden for at kaste et frisk blik på et udvalg af teorier og analyser i den udenrigspolitiske værktøjskasse. Det centrale spørgsmål for seminaret er, om og hvordan værkerne fra ’verden af i går’ fortsat kan informere produktionen af videnskabelig viden om ’verden af i dag’ og ’verden af i morgen.’ Med andre ord inviteres du til at give et udvalg af udenrigspolitiske teorier og analyser et grundigt serviceeftersyn samt bruge din viden til at formulere og besvare spændende udenrigspolitiske problemstillinger. Eksempler på spørgsmål, som vi vil beskæftige os med, er: Hvorfor fører stater en bestemt udenrigspolitik? Hvordan undersøger vi staters udenrigspolitik? Kan man bedst forstå staters udenrigspolitiske handlinger ud fra deres position i det internationale system, eller spiller enkeltpersoner en afgørende rolle? Spiller interne faktorer en vigtig – og måske væsentligere – rolle (fx national identitet, rivalisering mellem ministerier og værn, historiske analogier og strategisk kultur)? Hvordan er forholdet mellem materielle (fx militær og økonomisk magt) og immaterielle faktorer (fx kultur, identitet og status), når stater træffer udenrigspolitiske beslutninger? Formålet med dette seminar er at gøre dig i stand til (selv-)kritisk at forstå og forklare udenrigspolitiske fænomener i en verden, der synes at undergå stadig hurtigere og mere drastiske forandringer. Bachelorseminaret bygger oven på den grundviden, du oparbejdede i bachelorfaget ’International politik’, idet du gives tid til fordybelse i og grundig diskussion af udenrigspolitiske analyser og teorier. Dertil kommer, at du træner og oparbejder dine kompetencer i at kunne identificere, analysere, diskutere og vurdere metodologiske, metodiske, teoretiske og empiriske problemstillinger. Undervejs diskuterer vi, hvad der kendetegner en god bacheloropgave og gode problemformuleringer. Til at understøtte læringsmålene struktureres seminaret i tre hoveddele: Første del af seminaret introducerer dig til, hvad udenrigspolitisk analyse er.Endvidere hvordan den teoretiseres og undersøges. Således udgør den første del platformen, der danner fælles udgangspunkt for vores analyse, diskussion og vurdering af egne og andres teorier og analyser af udenrigspolitiske problemstillinger. Seminarets anden del fokuserer på et udvalg af udenrigspolitiske værker, der ud fra forskellige metodologiske, metodiske og teoretiske udgangspunkter undersøger staters udenrigspolitiske beslutningsprocesser og handlinger. Tredje del af seminaret udgøres af skrivepausen og vejledning. Det er her, at du skal bringe din viden og indsigt fra første og anden del af seminaret i spil. Det er også her, at den individuelle og kollektive vejledning foregår.\",\n",
            "    \"Efter dette bachelorseminar forventes du at kunne: Redegøre for, hvad der menes med metodologi, teoretisering samt centrale forskelle mellem case- og teoricentriske forskningsdesigns Kunne anvende din viden om metodologi, teoretisering og forskningsdesigns til at analysere, diskutere og vurdere den videnskabelige kvalitet af udvalgte og egne udenrigspolitiske teorier og analyser På baggrund af din vurdering af den videnskabelige kvalitet af udvalgte og egne udenrigspolitiske teorier og analyser opstille forslag til, hvordan kvaliteten kan forbedres, eller argumentere for, hvorfor dette ikke er hensigtsmæssigt eller muligt Kunne redegøre for, anvende og sammenligne udvalgte udenrigspolitiske teorier og analyser til selvstændigt at formulere, analysere og diskutere en selvvalgt udenrigspolitisk problemstilling Kunne vurdere, om og hvordan den videnskabelige kvalitet af din besvarelse af en selvvalgt udenrigspolitisk problemstilling kan forbedres, eller argumentere for, hvorfor dette ikke er hensigtsmæssigt eller muligt.\",\n",

            "  \"content\": \"Read more Vi befinder os i en brydningstid, hvor de hidtidige relationer og magtforhold mellem etablerede og nye aktører på den verdenspolitiske scene er under forandring. USA’s unipolære supermagtsstatus synes udfordret af Kina og Rusland. Endvidere har tyngdepunktet i diskussionen om USA’s fremtidige rolle på verdensscenen gradvist ændret sig fra USA’s evne til USA’s vilje til at garantere regional sikkerhed og stabilitet. Dertil kommer, at centrale multilaterale organisationer som NATO og EU synes politisk svækkede som følge af splittelserne medlemmerne imellem og et stigende udefrakommende pres fra begivenheder og aktører i både Vest, Øst og Syd. Brydningstider fordrer fundamentale diskussioner om hensigtsmæssigheden og tilpasningen til de forhold, der undergår forandring på nationalt og internationalt plan. Med andre ord udgør brydningstider såkaldte mulighedsvinduer for forandringer, der ikke før var mulige, men ultimativt også truslen om et komplet kollaps. Således udpegede den danske regering i 2015 Peter Taksøe-Jensen til at granske dansk udenrigspolitik. Det affødte udredningen Dansk diplomati og forsvar i en brydningstid , hvori Taksøe-Jensen kastede ”et frisk blik på hele spektret af instrumenter i den udenrigspolitiske værktøjskasse” og gjorde status på de eksisterende udenrigs- og sikkerhedspolitiske tanke- og handlemønstre. Dette seminar tilbyder dig muligheden for at kaste et frisk blik på et udvalg af teorier og analyser i den udenrigspolitiske værktøjskasse. Det centrale spørgsmål for seminaret er, om og hvordan værkerne fra ’verden af i går’ fortsat kan informere produktionen af videnskabelig viden om ’verden af i dag’ og ’verden af i morgen.’ Med andre ord inviteres du til at give et udvalg af udenrigspolitiske teorier og analyser et grundigt serviceeftersyn samt bruge din viden til at formulere og besvare spændende udenrigspolitiske problemstillinger. Eksempler på spørgsmål, som vi vil beskæftige os med, er: Hvorfor fører stater en bestemt udenrigspolitik? Hvordan undersøger vi staters udenrigspolitik? Kan man bedst forstå staters udenrigspolitiske handlinger ud fra deres position i det internationale system, eller spiller enkeltpersoner en afgørende rolle? Spiller interne faktorer en vigtig – og måske væsentligere – rolle (fx national identitet, rivalisering mellem ministerier og værn, historiske analogier og strategisk kultur)? Hvordan er forholdet mellem materielle (fx militær og økonomisk magt) og immaterielle faktorer (fx kultur, identitet og status), når stater træffer udenrigspolitiske beslutninger? Formålet med dette seminar er at gøre dig i stand til (selv-)kritisk at forstå og forklare udenrigspolitiske fænomener i en verden, der synes at undergå stadig hurtigere og mere drastiske forandringer. Bachelorseminaret bygger oven på den grundviden, du oparbejdede i bachelorfaget ’International politik’, idet du gives tid til fordybelse i og grundig diskussion af udenrigspolitiske analyser og teorier. Dertil kommer, at du træner og oparbejder dine kompetencer i at kunne identificere, analysere, diskutere og vurdere metodologiske, metodiske, teoretiske og empiriske problemstillinger. Undervejs diskuterer vi, hvad der kendetegner en god bacheloropgave og gode problemformuleringer. Til at understøtte læringsmålene struktureres seminaret i tre hoveddele: Første del af seminaret introducerer dig til, hvad udenrigspolitisk analyse er.Endvidere hvordan den teoretiseres og undersøges. Således udgør den første del platformen, der danner fælles udgangspunkt for vores analyse, diskussion og vurdering af egne og andres teorier og analyser af udenrigspolitiske problemstillinger. Seminarets anden del fokuserer på et udvalg af udenrigspolitiske værker, der ud fra forskellige metodologiske, metodiske og teoretiske udgangspunkter undersøger staters udenrigspolitiske beslutningsprocesser og handlinger. Tredje del af seminaret udgøres af skrivepausen og vejledning. Det er her, at du skal bringe din viden og indsigt fra første og anden del af seminaret i spil. Det er også her, at den individuelle og kollektive vejledning foregår.\",\n",

De står i skæringsfeltet mellem politik og administration og skal finde den rette balance i dagligdagens mange sager. I praksis er centraladministrationen dybt involveret i den politiske proces og i ministrenes samspil med Folketinget. Centraladministrationen er derfor en politisk institution på linje med Folketinget, regeringen og de politiske partier. Samtidig skal ministrene og ministeriernes embedsmænd på en lang række områder føre statens politik ud i livet uden skelen til partipolitiske hensyn. Formålet med dette seminar er at give deltagerne en dybdegående forståelse af denne vanskelige balancegang og dermed af det danske ministerstyre og centraladministrationen og dens politisk-administrative position. Deltagerne vil dermed opnå en teoretisk og praktisk indsigt i en helt central del af det danske politisk-administrative system, som desuden udgør et vigtigt arbejdsmarked for cand.scient.pol.’er. Som en integreret del af undervisningen vil der undervejs i forløbet blive organiseret en 1-dags studietur til København. I løbet af undervisningen vil de studerende blive introduceret til en række større datasæt, som vil kunne benyttes til udarbejdelsen af bachelorprojektet. Der vil også være mulighed for at gennemføre kvalitative analyser til brug for bachelorprojektet. Undervisningen vil bygge videre på grundgennemgangen i offentlig forvaltning. Fokus vil være på en grundig empirisk og teoretisk gennemgang og diskussion af det danske ministerstyre og centraladministrationen. Centrale emner vil være: Ministeriernes politiske ledelse; Ministrene og ministerstyret; Tværministeriel koordination; Ressortfordelingen mellem ministerierne; Ministerstyrets grænser; Centrale beslutningsprocesser samt Politiske embedsmænd og spindoktorer. De empiriske emner vil blive sat i teoretisk belysning ved en introduktion og diskussion af centrale forvaltningsteorier såsom rationel og sociologisk institutionalisme, principal/agent-teori, new public management og delegationsteori. Danske forhold vil blive sat i komparativt perspektiv ved inddragelse af litteratur om organiseringen af centraladministrationen i andre lande og i EU-systemet. Fokus vil være på alternative måder at organisere samspillet mellem politiske forvaltningschefer og embedsapparatet – eksempelvis de svenske uafhængige styrelser, de norske statssekretærer, det britiske system med juniorministre og EU-Kommissionens kabinetter.\",\n",

Betyder det, at Danmark er blevet et mere korrupt samfund? Måske, måske ikke. Ifølge internationale analyser, Transparency International, er der dog ingen tvivl om, at Danmark er en duksedreng i klassen. Men hvad er årsagerne til korruption – og hvilke konsekvenser har det for et samfund, hvis statsadministrationen er gennemsyret af ansatte, der hellere skeler til egen vinding end til varetagelse af de fastsatte regler, som de er ansat til at administrere. Det er de to hovedspørgsmål, som er seminarets omdrejningspunkt. Det tredje hovedspørgsmål følger af de to andre – for hvis korruption er negativt for et samfund, så er det væsentligt at kende ondets rod for dermed at få det bekæmpet. Men hvordan konstruerer man et effektivt anti-korruptionssystem? Dette BA-seminar går bag om fænomenet korruption og ser på relationen mellem korruption og centrale samfundsdynamikker og -forandringer, institutioner, kultur samt sociale forhold. Spørgsmål, som stilles, er blandt andet: Hvordan har korruption og ikke mindst opfattelsen af korruption ændret sig over tid? Hvorfor indgår almindelige borgere i korrupte relationer med andre? Hvilke institutioner fremmer henholdsvis hæmmer incitament til at indgå i korrupte relationer? Er nogle kulturer mere tilbøjelige til at acceptere korruption end andre og hvorfor? Hvilke samfundsøkonomiske, politiske og etiske konsekvenser har korruption? En central diskussion for besvarelsen af disse spørgsmål er, om korruption ses som en individuel, rationel kalkulation, der kan analyseres som et principal-agentproblem, eller om det er mere givende at se korruption som et kollektivt handlingsproblem. Seminaret beskæftiger sig med fænomenet korruption på såvel mikro- som makroniveau, og der vil være mulighed for at skrive opgaver med anvendelse af hele paletten af statsvidenskabelige metoder – stor-N, statistik på landeniveau eller individniveau, komparativ lande- eller sektoranalyse, kvalitative analyser eller anvendelse af eksperimenter. Seminaret vil forløbe i to spor: Hvor det ene spor koncentrerer sig om det ’korruptionsfaglige’ aspekt, ser det andet spor på metodemæssige problemstillinger. Centralt for BA-projekterne vil være forholdet mellem samfundsforhold, herunder for eksempel spørgsmål om magt, individualitet og identitet og korruption.\",\n",

Men hvordan kan demokratier reagere over for politiske aktører, der er imod demokrati (politiske ekstremister), eller som har problematiske opfattelser af centrale liberaldemokratiske principper såsom menneskerettigheder og retsstatsprincippet (visse typer populister)? For demokrati er dilemmaet, at nogle reaktioner på de opfattede trusler fra ovenstående type aktører umiddelbart medfører en reduktion af åbenheden, ytringsfriheden og lige demokratiske rettigheder og dermed ser ud til at konflikte med demokratiets egne grundprincipper. Klassiske eksempler er forbud mod visse politiske partier og bestemte former for politisk propaganda. Seminaret ser på klassiske såvel som aktuelle diskussioner af dette problem. Det vil studere forskellige midler til at modsætte sig anti-liberaldemokratiske kræfter. Nogle af disse er juridiske, fx propaganda- og partiforbud. Men andre er politiske, fx udelukkelsen af visse partier fra politisk indflydelse (cordon sanitaire) eller - omvendt - deres inklusion i almindelig politik med henblik på at fremkalde ideologisk moderation hos dem. Endnu andre midler er kulturelle, såsom indlæring af demokratiske værdier i skolen, og offentlige støtte til civilsamfundsorganisationer, der arbejder på at fremme demokratiet. Og endelig er der socioøkonomiske politikker, som fx skal sikre at borgerne har tilstrækkelige økonomiske forhold, så de er mindre tilbøjelige til at støtte ikke-liberale demokratiske synspunkter og partier. Seminaret vil endvidere undersøge, hvad de rigtige roller er for borgere, de forskellige statsmagter (udøvende, lovgivende, dømmende) og eksterne aktører som andre stater, over- og internationale organisationer i forsvaret af demokratiet. Vi vil diskutere, i hvor høj grad disse forskellige strategier og midler har vist sig effektive, og om de er normativt tilladelige set ud fra et demokratisk synspunkt. Seminaret er baseret på normativ politisk teori, men henvender sig også til studerende, der er interesserede i empiriske spørgsmål, fx om hvilke midler der er effektive i imødegåelsen af anti-liberale demokratiske bevægelser og partier. Undervisningen vil være baseret på klasse- og gruppediskussioner og -fremlæggelser. Den har blandt hovedmålene at generere emner og mulige problemstillinger for bacheloropgaverne.

            "    \"The discussion about terrorism is – more than 10 years after the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2011 – still relevant. Within a little over a year, we have seen a handful of cases; the case against the Horserød-Stutthoff Association and Den Faglige Klub in Copenhagen for financially supporting FARC; the bomber Lors Doukaiev, who, by mistake, detonated a bomb at Hotel Jørgensen in Copenhagen, which was presumably aimed at Jyllands-Posten ; a man of Somali origin in an assassination attempt on Kurt Westergaard; the suspension of ROY TV’s broadcast permit for two months for uncritically defending the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK; and the case against four persons in Sweden for planning an attack on Politiken/Jyllands-Posten in 2012. However, the discussion about terrorism not only concerns these and other previous and future attacks on our society. The attacks place Denmark in an international context. The terror is often international, which is why the attempts at fighting it should also be so. A focus on isolated attacks and court cases is also problematic for another reason: The prevention of terrorism has consequences for the lives lived by ordinary people, which is why discussing phenomena such as surveillance, suspicious culture, “security architecture”, and entrenched communities is also relevant in connection with counter-terrorism. Safety policy has moved into areas where it used to be seen as an alien element, and it contributes to changing our society and way of life. On the one hand, the seminar will introduce the new threat scenario and departure in counter-terrorism and, on the other, try to understand this in the context of more general changes in society. An important ambition in this connection is to relate terrorism and counter-terrorism to a number of concise social diagnoses; for example, the network society (Baudrillard, Hardt & Negri), the risk society (Beck), the society of exception (Agamben, Bauman), the world community (Huntington, Kagan), and the surveillance society (Lyon, Rose). By applying these social diagnoses and analyses, it becomes possible to examine terrorism and counter-terrorism as phenomena. Conversely, however, the actual study of terrorism and attempts at approaching it may result in more general insights. The field of terrorism, if one such exists, is not a marginal and curious field. By studying it, it becomes possible to obtain general insights in the character of modern or postmodern society. Terrorism and counter-terrorism accentuate or reformulate a wide range of major, classic questions; for example, the question of the good life, of the character and function of politics, and of the social constitution of the individual. The seminar has an interdisciplinary ambition. It draws on literature and discussions within international politics, law, political theory, sociology, psychology, organizational theory, media science, and religious theory. Moreover, the seminar includes popular culture and high culture that thematize terrorism and counter-terrorism both as an independent object of study and an educational lever. The seminar is based on lectures, student presentations, group discussions, and individual supervision. Overview of seminar classes I: The idea of the seminar and the concept of terrorism 1.

Hvorfor er Latinamerika stadig præget af voldsom ulighed og kriminalitet, på trods af at den generelle velstand har været stigende og efterhånden nærmer sig den vestlige? Hvordan kan det være, at Singapore, Sydkorea og Kina har oplevet enorme levestandardsstigninger under autokratisk styre, når Zimbabwe, Congo og Tanzania har oplevet stagnerende og i perioder faldende levestandarder under autokratisk styre? I forlængelse heraf hvilke befolkningsmæssige udfordringer står folkerige lande som Kina og Indien overfor de kommende år, og hvordan kan de tackles? Hvorfor lider et land som Afghanistan under mange af de ovennævnte onder, herunder fattigdom, ustabilt styre, svag stat og konflikt? Spørgsmål som disse vil vi forsøge at besvare på dette seminar, hvor vi kommer til at beskæftige os med samfundsforhold i det Globale Syd, en betegnelse som overvejende dækker ikke-vestlige regioner (dvs. Afrika syd for Sahara, Latinamerika, Asien, Mellemøsten og Nordafrika). På seminaret kommer vi til at beskæftige os med emner som fattigdom, ulighed, demografi, korruption, kriminalitet, politisk styreform og etnisk konflikt, samt hvordan de hænger sammen. Vi kommer til at se på specifikke udviklingstendenser inden for de forskellige regioner, men også globalt. Vi ser på udvikling i komparativt perspektiv, men både ved hjælp af kvalitative og kvantitative tilgange. Seminaret har et stærkt empirisk fokus med det formål at give jer et godt indblik i, hvordan samfund uden for Vesten fungerer, og hvilke udfordringer de står overfor. Ud over den teoretiske og empiriske forskning på området indeholder seminaret elementer, som har til formål at styrke jeres generelle analytiske færdigheder. Blandt andet vil vi bruge tid på at studere teoriernes grundpræmisser for at træne jer i at få øje på, og dermed diskutere, de antagelser, som ligger bag mange argumenter, men som sommetider er skjulte eller implicitte. Derudover kommer vi omkring distinktionen mellem variansbaseret og casebaseret forskning, som er central for at kunne vurdere gyldigheden af teoretiske argumenter og empiriske fund. I løbet af seminaret vil I blive introduceret til mere specifikke kvantitative og kvalitative metoder, som ofte anvendes inden for feltet. Seminaret er struktureret i tre blokke. Først introduceres I til feltet, dets kernebegreber og grundlæggende teoretiske samt metodologiske tilgange. Den anden blok sætter fokus på økonomisk udvikling og fattigdom, herunder hvorfor fattigdom kan være selvforstærkende. I den tredje blok ser vi på bredere samfundsfænomener som korruption, kriminalitet, konflikt og ulighed. Vi har 11 x 4 timers undervisning, som kommer til at ligge inden påske med undervisning én dag om ugen, dvs. fire timer i træk. Idéen med dette er, at vi så får tid til, at den sidste del af hver session bruges på hands-on-arbejde med en case eller en metode, så I får træning i de forskellige metoder i praksis, som gør jer i stand til at udføre den fulde analyse til jeres bacheloropgave. Tiden efter påske er dedikeret til jeres arbejde med bacheloropgaverne. Da vil der være flere vejledningssessioner i form af både gruppevejledning og individuel vejledning.\",\n",

I den offentlige debat hævdes det ofte, at nyhedsmedierne er blevet mere magtfulde, og nogle meningsdannere og forskere mener, at journalisterne giver borgerne en fordrejet opfattelse af virkeligheden. I dette seminar prøver vi at undersøge, hvad mediernes indflydelse består i, og om medierne har så stor betydning for borgernes holdninger og virkelighedsopfattelse, som det påstås. Seminaret tager udgangspunkt i nyere forskning om politisk kommunikation, medialisering og nyhedsmediernes organisering, og det henvender sig til alle, der interesserer sig for samspillet mellem medier og politik. Samtidig er det særlig relevant for de, der ønsker at arbejde med politisk kommunikation efter studietiden. Seminaret er inddelt i to blokke, som svarer til to overordnede måder, hvorpå nyhedsmedierne kan påvirke borgerne på. I den første blok kigger vi nærmere på, hvordan og hvorfor medierne anvender bestemte frames, og hvordan disse påvirker borgerne. Vi vil blandt andet se nærmere på, hvordan normer og økonomiske incitamenter påvirker journalisternes valg, og vi skal også diskutere, om framing virkelig er et effektivt et redskab til at flytte holdninger. I den anden blok ser vi nærmere på, hvordan nyhedsmedierne udvælger nyheder, og hvordan deres valg påvirker borgerne. Vi vil blandt andet diskutere, hvorvidt udvælgelsen afspejler mediernes egne logikker, eller om medierne blot følger politikernes og borgernes ønsker. Vi vil også se nærmere på forskellige typer mediebias. Eksempelvis vil vi undersøge, om der virkelig findes ”røde” og ”blå” medier, og om medierne er så vilde med negativitet og konflikt, som nogle meningsdannere har påstået i de senere år. Foruden det substantielle indhold vil seminaret også indeholde en kortere gennemgang af visse centrale kvantitative metoder, som er særligt brugbare, når man studerer nyhedsmediernes indhold og deres effekt på borgerne. Konkret vil der være fokus på eksperimentel metode og nyere tilgange, som kan muliggøre kvantitativ indholdsanalyse af store mængder data. Undervejs i seminaret vil det løbende blive diskuteret, hvordan man udvælger en god problemstilling og skriver en god bacheloropgave.\",\n",

            "  \"content\": \"Read more Et af de prominente emner i det seneste tiårs akademiske såvel som bredere debat om et ‘nyt Mellemøsten’ efter de arabiske revolter har handlet om shia-/sunni-skellet og sekterisme i mellemøstlig politik. Nogle observatører har henvist til, hvordan ”a sectarian wave washes over the Middle East” og beskrevet “the new sectarianism” som “a dominant ideological trend” og “a central mobilizing factor”. Det er svært helt at afskrive sekterisme som en faktor, hvis man vender blikket mod den syriske borgerkrig, shia-militsers kamp mod IS i Irak; det seneste årtis rivalisering mellem Iran og Saudi-Arabien; Bahrains al Khalifa-monarkis brug af det ”sekteriske kort” i sin regimeoverlevelsesstrategi; den yemenitiske konflikt, hvor huthierne, al-Qaida, såvel som den saudiskledede ’sunni-alliance’ har gjort brug af sekterisk retorik; i Libanons ”consociational” politiske system; den saudiske undertrykkelse af landets shiitiske mindretal eller valgkampene til det kuwaitiske parlament. Andre observatører har til gengæld kritiseret det “sekteriske masternarrativ” som udtryk for en essentialiserende orientalisme, der “exceptionaliserer” Mellemøsten og fjerner fokus fra de egentlige konfliktlinjer og ”drivers” i regional politik. Her henvises der både til, hvordan forskellige aktører instrumentelt bruger det sekteriske kort i en ganske velkendt kamp om magt og ressourcer, og hvordan der fra det syriske oprørs begyndelse i 2011 til de seneste saudi-iranske tilnærmelser kontinuerligt har været eksempler på tværsekterisk samarbejde og anti-sekteriske aktivisme. Imellem disse poler har der gennem de senere år været en voksende interesse for hverken at reducere mellemøstlig politik til sekterisme eller helt at ignorere den sekteriske faktor. I stedet har der været et ønske om at få en bedre indsigt i, hvor/når/for/dan sekterisme spiller en rolle, hvilke politiske implikationer det har for et ”nyt Mellemøsten”, og hvorvidt/dan studiet af sekterisk politik kan trække på, men også berige teorier og analytiske redskaber fra den bredere forskning om identitetspolitik, etnisk politik, international politik, sociale bevægelser, demokratisering og autokratier. Det er denne trend i studiet af sekterisk politik i et ’nyt Mellemøsten’, som danner omdrejningspunktet for dette BA-opgaveseminar. Mere specifikt er seminaret opdelt i en række overordnede dimensioner. For det første hvad handler shia-/sunni-spørgsmålet i islam overhovedet om? Og giver det mening at bruge en ”sekterisk linse”, som oprindeligt kommer fra en vestlig kristen sammenhæng, og hvordan kan man med kvalitative og kvantitative metoder observere sekterisme uden at se ”for meget” eller ”for lidt”? For det andet hvordan skal sekterisk politik studeres? Er sekterisk politik sammenlignelig med andre former for identitetspolitik, således at man kan bruge almindelige politologiske teorier, eller er det nødvendigt at trække på helt andre faglige traditioner? Hvordan kan forholdet mellem religion og politik begrebsliggøres, og er det analytisk frugtbart at lave sammenligninger mellem det aktuelle shia-/sunni-split i Mellemøsten og fx Nordirlandskonflikten eller den europæiske Trediveårskrig mellem katolikker og protestanter? For det tredje hvor i Mellemøsten spiller sekterisk politik især en rolle i dag, og har betydningen af sekterisk politik forandret sig i forhold til tidligere perioder? For det fjerde hvordan forklarer man, at shia-/sunni-spørgsmålet i de seneste år er kommet til at spille en central rolle i nogle, men ikke andre dele af regionen? Bør man søge tilbage til slaget ved Kerbala i 680, eller skal man snarere se det i lyset af den aktuelle geopolitiske situation, eller er det relevante perspektiv den nære fortid i form af udviklingen i Mellemøsten siden slut-1970erne? Endelig er der for det femte spørgsmålet om, hvilke politiske implikationer de forstærkede shia-/sunni-spændinger har for international politik i Mellemøsten, herunder alliancedannelser og konfliktformer; for det mellemøstlige statssystems karakter; for det politiske liv i de enkelte mellemøstlige stater, herunder demokratisering og autokratiske regimeoverlevelsesteknikker, og endeligt for den islamistiske scene. Seminaret vil bl.a. være særligt relevant for studerende med interesse for identitetspolitik, demokratisering og autoritære regimer, forholdet mellem religion og politik, islamisme, ikke-statslige aktører, borgerkrige, internationale konflikter, alliancemønstre og udenrigspolitik samt udviklingen i Mellemøsten før og efter de arabiske revolter. Undervisningsformen veksler mellem dialogbaserede forelæsninger, studenteroplæg såvel som fælles diskussion og er kontinuerligt fokuseret på, at seminaret skal udmønte sig i en hjemmeopgave. Der planlægges endvidere en række (virtuelle) gæsteforelæsninger med forskere fra det internationale forskningsprojekt ’TOI: Bringing in the Other Islamists’ og en studietur til København med besøg hos relevante institutioner. Endelig indgår e-learning via Brightspace som en vigtig del af undervisningen. Det forventes, at deltagerne ikke blot er aktive på timerne, men også ifm. e-learning-aktiviteterne.\",\n",
